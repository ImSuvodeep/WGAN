Make sure to customize the following parameters in the code according to your requirements:

n_epochs: Number of training epochs
crit_cycles: Number of critic training cycles per generator training step
z_dim: Dimensionality of the noise vector
wandbact: Flag indicating whether to use Weights & Biases for logging (set to 1 for active, 0 for inactive)
Other relevant parameters for your specific use case
Dependencies
Python 3.x
PyTorch
tqdm
Weights & Biases (optional, set wandbact accordingly)
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Training Process
The training loop iterates through epochs, training the critic and generator alternatively. Critic training involves calculating the Wasserstein distance, and generator training aims to minimize the critic's ability to distinguish real from fake samples.

Visualization
The code provides visualizations of generated and real samples during training. Additionally, losses are logged using Weights & Biases for easy monitoring.
